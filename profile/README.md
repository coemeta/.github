These are Open Source & Public Work repositories from [CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz), a Public Benefit company providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. 

> As our [name](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/blob/main/name.md) reflects, CoŒµmeta is about **_finding truth together_**: \
> Making **better sense** for **better places** through **better information, relation & process**.

This is done in the spirit of **[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)**, contributing to **[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)**, "**finding the others**" & **leaving a trail + some resources** for those that follow. 

Comments, questions & suggestions are welcome via **Pull Requests**, **Issues** or **Discussions**!
